# GreenShadow Front-End üåø‚ú®

GreenShadow is a dynamic front-end application built using **React.js**. This project serves as the user interface for the GreenShadow platform, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience. It integrates seamlessly with the backend to create an environment-focused solution that aims to educate and engage users in sustainability efforts.

## Features üöÄ

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Modern UI/UX**: A clean and intuitive user interface, with easy navigation.
- **Dynamic Content**: Fetches real-time data to display the latest environmental statistics.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React hooks and Context API for managing application state efficiently.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular components to ensure consistency and maintainability across the app.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Ensures functionality and appearance are consistent across all modern browsers.
  
### Additional HTML/CSS UI Screenshots üìÇ

I also developed the same UI using **HTML** and **CSS**. You can explore those screenshots by visiting the following [Google Drive link]([YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oJU7fXtKyHDmLj-U1UK87y-RMb9ENcb9?usp=sharing)). These images will give you a glimpse of the design before the React-based version was implemented. Feel free to compare and see the evolution of the interface.
